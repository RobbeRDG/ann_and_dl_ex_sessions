    "# 3. Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning technique that uses the concept of *local connectivity*. The idea is that in a lot of datasets, tensor elements that are close to each other, are likely to be a lot more connected than tensor elements that are further away. For example, the elements in an image tensor represent pixels. Pixels that are spatially close to each other are likely to represent the same part of the image, while pixels that are further away can represent different parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are explained in [this Stanford tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Classifying MNIST with a CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we are going to train a basic CNN on the MNIST dataset. Let's first take a look at how we can implement a CNN in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1 Implementing a Simple CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use [`nn.Conv2d()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html) to create a single convolutional layer in PyTorch. Some of its interesting arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `in_channels`: the number of channels in the input tensor. When the input is an RGB image, this is `3`. For a single-channel gray scale image, this is `1`. Note that each convolution filter in the layer will have this amount of channels as the filter needs to cover the *entire depth* of the input.\n",
    "- `out_channels`: the number of convolution filters that this layer has. Each filter will produce a new channel in the output. As such, if another `nn.Conv2d()` takes the output of this layer as its input, that layer's `in_channels` should be set to this layer's `out_channels`.\n",
    "- `kernel_size`: the height and width of the convolution filters. If this is a single integer, it will be used for both the height and the width (i.e., square filters).\n",
    "- `stride`: the stride (step size) of the convolution operation (default: `1`).\n",
    "- `padding`: the amount of padding to add to the input (default: `0`). *Padding* is a border of black pixels that is added around the input image. This allows more of the convolution operation to be applied to the pixels at the edge of the image and can avoid the output resolution to shrink w.r.t. the input resolution. When `padding` is set to `1`, a black border of a single pixel wide will be added at each image edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from convolutional layers, a CNN also typically contains *pooling layers*. Similar to conv layers, a pooling layer uses a sliding window to operate on its input. Instead of computing an inner product, however, the pooling window **aggregates** the underlying values, e.g., by computing the *maximum* or *average* value. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`nn.MaxPool2d()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MaxPool2d.html) applies max pooling.\n",
    "- [`nn.AvgPool2d()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.AvgPool2d.html) applies average pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like `nn.Conv2d()`, these pooling layers take `kernel_size`, `stride` (default: `1`) and `padding` (default: `0`) as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pooling layers also have *adaptive* equivalents: [`nn.AdaptiveMaxPool2d()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.AdaptiveMaxPool2d.html) and [`nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d.html). These adaptive layers produce an **output of a fixed, predefined width and height no matter the input size** (the number of channels stays the same). This is in contrast with regular pooling layers, where the output size depends on the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copy-paste the following CNN implementation in the cell below and complete it.** Note that we did not always specify the number of input channels and input features, as you should be able to infer these from the previous layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### 3.1.2 Preparing the Data for Mini-Batch Training\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we passed *the entire* MNIST dataset in batch through the model during training. This is possible because each MNIST image consists of only a single $28\\times 28$ channel and there are *only* 60 000 training images in the dataset. In real-world computer vision applications, the images are typically much larger in size and number, making it infeasible or impossible to train with batches containing the entire training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, it is customary to train CNNs on **mini-batches**. Each such mini-batch contains only a fraction of all samples available in the training dataset. After each forward pass with a mini-batch, the parameters of the model are updated. When the model has seen all training samples, a single epoch is done. Before each of the next epoch(s), the data can be shuffled such that mini-batches always contain other combinations of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into mini-batch training with PyTorch, let's first learn about PyTorch **[`Dataset`s](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset)**.

    "## 3.2 Using a Pre-Trained CNN as Deep Feature Extractor\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"old\" days of computer vision, researchers put a lot of effort in developing hand-crafted algorithms that could extract descriptive *features* from an image. Typical examples of such algorithms are SIFT, SURF and HOG. These general features can be used for a down-stream task like classification, which would be trained with a machine learning algorithm like SVM, taking the features as an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the advent of deep learning, CNNs have shown impressive capabilities as general feature extractors, often outperforming hand-crafted features by a large margin. An easy way to leverage the power of CNNs, without investing time and effort into training, is to use a *pre-trained CNN* as a feature extractor. This is a CNN that is already trained on a very large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.1 Loading Pre-Trained Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "The `torchvision` library of PyTorch [contains many popular neural network architectures](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html) with the option to load pre-trained weights. Below, we import a ResNet-50 model ([He et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)) and load in weights that were obtained after training the model on ImageNet1K ([Deng et al., 2009](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.kuleuven.e-bronnen.be/document/5206848)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also call [`eval()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module.eval) on the model. This sets the model in *evaluation mode*, which is important because the [BatchNorm](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html?highlight=batchnorm#torch.nn.BatchNorm2d) layers of ResNet have a different behaviour in training and evaluation mode. Similarly, calling `train()` on a model switches the model back to training mode. **From now on, make it a habbit to always call `eval()` before evaluating your model** (so, also before your validation loop) **and `train()` before training the model.** "
